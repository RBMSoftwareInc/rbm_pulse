# 🚨 URGENT: Deploy the NEW Build NOW!

## ✅ What Just Happened

I **JUST** rebuilt your app with the correct Supabase credentials embedded.  
The previous build you deployed had **EMPTY** environment variables.

## 🔍 Proof the New Build is Correct

✅ **Supabase URL is embedded** in the JavaScript  
✅ **Supabase Key is embedded** in the JavaScript  
✅ **Build timestamp:** Just now (fresh build)

## 📤 DEPLOY THIS BUILD IMMEDIATELY

**Location:** `/Users/rbmsoft/RBM/RBM-Pulse/rbm_pulse/build/web/`
